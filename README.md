# Rainbow Bullet

## Description

RAINBOW BULLET is a top-down shooter game where the objective is to survive as enemies come and attack you. Your bullets are colorized, and can only damage enemies that are equal to their color. One mismatch may spell your fate.

## Gameplay

The flow of the game is a wave-based game that gets progressively harder per wave. Enemies spawn in the side and corners of the map with the goal of trying to defeat the player. The waves are endless, and there are intermissions in-between waves which serve as a time for the player to prepare.

## Color Coding

The color coding mechanic is where projectiles can only damage enemies or objects that have the same color as the projectile. In the game, each enemy has a randomized color, and the following colors are present: Green, Yellow, Blue, and Purple.
  
- **Primary Colors**
  
  - Primary colors are the colors that are common in the game, you have to shoot someone with the same color in order to deal damage to them.

- **Rainbow Color**
  
  - A rainbow color can damage all known colors in the game.

## Weaponry

In RAINBOW BULLET, the player can only use projectile weapons, such as guns. There may be a melee option (?) where the player can attack which is similar to melee in CoD. Weapons are unlocked by an interval of 5 waves, and afterward, they are able to switch between their unlocked equipment. There is no ammo system in the game, and all guns have infinite ammo.

In the game, there will be four gun types, each are unlocked by an interval of 5 waves:

- The pistol is the starter weapon of the player that they start off. This is a semi-automatic, that only shoots one projectile per interval. Deals medium damage and applies minimal knockback.
- The shotgun will be the secondary weapon that the player will unlock, this shoots out multiple projectiles per interval, that are spread out. Each projectile deals small damage and applies minimal knockback, the more projectiles that get hit by an enemy, the knockback increases.
- The assault rifle will be the third weapon that the player will unlock, shoots out rapid-fire projectiles that deal medium damage, however, has minimal knockback.
- The sniper is the final weapon that can be unlocked, shoots fast and strong projectiles that deal massive damage and massive feedback

## Projectiles

There are two types of projectiles in the game: paint bullets and rainbow bullets. Paint bullets only deal damage to things that have the same color as them, while rainbow bullets deal damage to any type of enemy. 

## Objectives

The objective of the game is to survive for as long as many waves as you can. The losing condition is when you die, either by yourself or to your enemies. This game is infinite, and the general objective is to have a higher score than your record.

## Buff Pickups
